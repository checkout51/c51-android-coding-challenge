# Checkout 51 Coding Challenge

# Why a take-home interview?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home gives you a chance work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

We want you to be at your best and most comfortable, just as you would be in our office environment

# Requirements

Given the json file “c51.json” create an application with one screen that turns it into a list. 

The file contains a list of offers and their attributes. Each row in the list must contain the offer name, its image and the cashback value in dollars. 

You can consume the list as file resource from the app or host it on a network using a simple service like “http://myjson.com/”. 

Feel free to build it in any way you want using any framework, architecture and tools at your disposal. Bonus points if you create a way for a user to sort the offers by name or cash back.

This is a relatively simple app, however we are looking for more than just the task to be completed.  At Checkout 51, we take the craftmanship of the code seriously, and want to see evidence that you do as well.  We are looking for software that is well structured, concise and testable.


## Android Specifics
Depending on your skills you can write in Java, Kotlin or a combination of both. Over time, we are porting the app from Java to Kotlin, so feel free to do what makes the most sense for you.

## Full-Stack Specifics
We're primarily a PHP shop, but we are looking to gradually move away from PHP. PHP is still the preferred technology for this assignment, but we have components written in React.js, Node.js and Java, so feel free to mix these technologies in as well where they make sense.

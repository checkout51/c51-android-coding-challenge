# Why a take-home interview?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home gives you a chance work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

We want you to be at your best and most comfortable, just as you would be in our office environment

# Requirements

Given the json file “c51.json” create an android application with one screen that turns it into a list. 

The file contains a list of offers and their attributes. Each row in the list must contain the offer name, its image and the cashback value in dollars. 

You can consume the list as file resource from the app or host it on a network using a simple service like “http://myjson.com/”. 

Feel free to build it in any way you want using any framework, architecture and tools at your disposal. Depending on your skills you can write in Java, Kotlin or a combination of both. Bonus points if you create a way for a user to sort the offers by name or cash back.


# Response Directions

1. Use settings to update myjson host
2. With no network or no host, will fallback to file in assets for json
3. Minimal tests are include for patterns
